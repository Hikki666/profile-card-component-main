## My process

I started with HTML first, then added all the styling with CSS.

I made sure that the website would be **responsive** and not *static*, meaning the website will change based on the width of the user's device, that's being used to view the website.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (Just a little)
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the basic styling of buttons... yay!
